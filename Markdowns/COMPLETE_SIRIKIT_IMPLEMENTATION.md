4. **Iterate**: Refine voice patterns and sound suggestions based on user feedback

### ðŸŽ‰ **Implementation Complete**

The SiriKit integration is now complete with full sound support! Users can:

- Create tickers with voice commands including sound preferences
- Benefit from AI-powered natural language processing for complex requests
